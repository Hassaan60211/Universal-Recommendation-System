**Project Description:**<br>
<br>Our group is developing a universal recommendation system to provide personalized recommendations to a large user base. This system is designed to help users find relevant items based on their preferences, behavior, and other factors. With the overwhelming amount of data and information available, it can be challenging for users to find what they need quickly and efficiently. Our recommendation system addresses this problem by offering personalized suggestions that save users time and effort while improving their overall experience.<br>
Our system consists of four unique features: a content-based movie recommendation system, a book recommendation system using collaborative filtering, a music recommendation system using collaborative filtering and cosine similarity, and a fashion recommendation system based on deep learning CNN. Each feature serves a specific purpose in providing personalized recommendations to users.<br>
We are using Python, Django, and Flask for the backend and HTML and CSS for the front end of our recommendation system. By implementing these four features, we aim to provide a comprehensive and personalized recommendation system that will improve user engagement, satisfaction, and conversion rates for businesses.
